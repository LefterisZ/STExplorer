\title{Internal: Update Fuzzy Membership with Spatial Influence}
\usage{
.int_membershipUpdate(data, old_uij, mi.mj, dist, alpha, beta, a, b)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A matrix or data frame of the dataset, where rows are
observations and columns are features. This parameter is included
for potential extensions but is not used in the current implementation.}

\item{old_uij}{A matrix of previous fuzzy memberships.}

\item{mi.mj}{A matrix representing the influence of population between
all pairs of regions (typically population_i * population_j).}

\item{dist}{A matrix of distances between regions; this should be
a square matrix with dimensions n by n.}

\item{alpha}{The weighting of the old membership in the update,
often denoted as the retention factor.}

\item{beta}{The weighting of the spatial influence in the update.}

\item{a}{The exponent for distance influence; controls how distance
affects spatial weighting.}

\item{b}{The exponent for population influence; controls how population
size affects spatial weighting.}
}
\value{
A matrix of updated fuzzy memberships, combining previous
membership with spatially influenced adjustments.
}
\description{
This function updates the fuzzy membership matrix for geographical
weighted clustering, combining the previous membership with spatial
influences from population and distance.
}
\details{
This function is a copy of the \code{renew_uij} function from the
\code{naspaclust} R package.
